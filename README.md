#H1 Animal Crossing API
---
##H2 Why are we doing this?
This project was completed as a result of the learning done throughout the software development bootcamp. The end product is a SpringBoot API with CRUD functionality, in which the user can model and input villagers from the popular video game series Animal Crossing.

In particular, this project utilised Agile & Project Management (Git, Jira) Databases & Cloud Fundamentals (H2, MySQL) Programming Fundamentals (Java) API Development (Spring Boot) Automated Testing (JUnit, Mockito).

##H2 How I expected the challenge to go?
I expected to have my understanding of Java and Spring Boot to be challenged as I provided evidence for this, which it was. In particular I had to ensure that all the learning done with regards to the rest controller and service methods were correct, which I did successfully.

##H2 what went well? What didn't go as planned?
I think writing the initial codebase went fairly smoothly as I understood much of the content whilst learning in structured time. Initially, my poor use of git and github hampered me because it lead to the deletion of chunks of the codebase (maybe not something I should be admitting here!) but in the end I feel like the mistakes I made with git have strengthened my understansing of best practice for the future so as they say every mistake is a lesson! :)

##H2 Possible improvements for future revisions of the project:
I know that I could improve on the formatting of the code (the Birthday column in particular) and also it could be refactored somewhat to make it look more clean and legible.
Beyond this, there is scope to add additional functionality, such as a method for rating villagers and listing them in order of preference.
